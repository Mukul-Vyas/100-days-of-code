Cats and the mouse moves with the same speed. Suppose it is by 1 on x-axis.
Lets define the difference between their positions: (cat A, mouse), (cat B, mouse).

  dam = |a - m|

  dbm = |b - m|
where

  a

,

  b

,

  m

are coordinates on

  x

-axis.

The results
â€“ If

  d_{am} == dbm

-> "Mouse C"
â€“ If

  damdbm

-> "Cat A"
â€“ Else -> "Cat B"
